## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am building an inventory app for a nonprofit startup I work with called Kanbe's Markets. Kanbe's takes produce from produce wholesalers and grocers that is slated to go to waste and repackages it for distribution at corner stores in Kansas City's food deserts. Food deserts are areas where residents do not have access to any sort of fresh produce. These areas tend to be low income, and their lack of a healthy food source contributes to poor health and growing inequality. Due to the nature of how Kanbe's sources produce, the vegetables and fruits they distribute can change every day at each location. Kanbe's needs a tool for them to keep track of food inventory, and for patrons to check when fresh produce has been delivered. 

### Features
I see this as a standard CRUD application. Admin users will have CRUD capabilities, while the public facing app will be a map of locations with regularly updated listings of deliveries.

    • User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
    • Database: Users will be able to create, read, update, and delete delivery information.
    • Map: Delivery information will be attached to a map of locations.

### Technologies
Include Technologies here
• Javascript
• React.js framework
• MAMP/PHP
• MySQL
• SQLAlchemy
• Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
I plan to incorporate a map with Google Maps/API that shows all the locations and ideally links to their delivery updates. Also, I want to learn a framework used by many of the app development companies I have talked to: React.js.
